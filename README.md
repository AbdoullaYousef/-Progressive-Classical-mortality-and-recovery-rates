# -Progressive-Classical-mortality-and-recovery-rates

Considering a town of 2000 people, our task is to compute recovery rate
and death rate due to an infectious diseaseX.

Note that the recovery time is 12 days (after infection).

Starting with 5 infected people and keeping the rate of infection (spreading rate)
as a random number. After some time, the whole town is infected, where some of people died and others survived.

Our task is to compute the progressive & classical mortality and recovery
rates.
